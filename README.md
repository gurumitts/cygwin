RXVT config for cygwin 
=====

While you are selecting the packages you want to install during the cygwin installation process select rxvt(only available in 32-bit cygwin as of 9/16/2014).  

Place the .Xdefaults and .bashrc file in your cygwin home folder (~/)

Instead of using the default cygwin shortcut, create a new shortcut with the following:

C:\cygwin\bin\rxvt.exe -e /bin/bash --login -i

Enjoy a usable terminal  


Update
Just found out about mintty - https://code.google.com/p/mintty/.  Will leave this here is incase anyone is interested in rxvt still.
